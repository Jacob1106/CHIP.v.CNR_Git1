Lay Out of Initial Annalysis of NuRD: 

1. Import and Filter: 
->. Func = import_samples 
->. Fitler_by pvalue + chromosome List 

2. Unpack the List of GRange Objects into conditions. E.g. CNR vs CHIP: 
->  E.G. CNR_List <- list[2:4]

3. Convert to a GRangeList Object 
-> GRangesList()

4. Produced a merged GRange Object based on minimum number of overlaps: 
-> overlapGRangeList(GrangeList, num_of_overlaps_required)

5. Dofferential Peak analysis: 
    Convert the finalised objects into unique and overlaped objects. 

6. Write these new BED files 

7. Look at proportion overlap: 
-> proportionOverlapTibble(2 objects, 2 overlaps, 2 unique )

8. Do width Analysis: 
widthGGplot

9. Do peak annotations for unique peaks and overlapped peaks

10. Make merged BigWig files for each conditon DeepTools 

11. Make a matrix using reference point - depending on specificity of target adjust start region and end region (-3000-3000 or -10000-10000)

12. Make Heat maps Deep Tools
